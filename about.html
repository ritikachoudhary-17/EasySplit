           <!-- Description of the "Easy Split" service -->
A lot of back and forth through chat groups seems to be required in order to decide on an activity, a time, who can go, and then to control expenditures. Even after everything is decided, you still have to navigate back and forth to figure out the totals, the venue's specifics, and who has paid.
<br /><br />
Coming up with the right amounts of money and the transactions (who pays to whom how much) to clear a group's costs and to settle debts can be tedious task
- often only solved with the help of spreadsheets. It even becomes more complicated when one or more spendings are not shared by the whole group (e.g. one friend
did not want to join the group for the museum trip paid by another friend for everyone). <br /><br />
We therefore established <u>"Easy Split"</u> to provide people with an easy, free, fast and
realiable way to split up their group costs after holidays, partys, presents, festivals, vactions, trips, weddings or in clubs and shared apartments and so much more. Everything happens in the browser without installation of an App on mobile phones. Since then it saves groups in which everyone paid some bills from arguments and wasting time after the fun is over.
